				Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional, or psychological strain. Stress is your body's response to anything that requires attention or action. 
				Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way you respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to your overall well-being.

				<p style="color:beige;">
					As a means of survival, humans have evolved down through the ages in a way that they can recognise and react to any external threats posed to them. The fight-or-flight response, or acute stress response, is a reaction that occurs in response to a perceived threat to survival. Essentially, when we feel we are in danger, our mind tells our body to get ready to fight, flee or freeze. In the modern world, this can happen when we feel overwhelmed by what is being asked of us and feel under-resourced for coping with these demands. We can perceive this as being a threat to our physical or psychological well-being.

		<br><br><b><p style="color:beige;">Learning more effective ways to manage stress</b><br><br>
			When feeling stressed a natural, human reaction is to try to cope by doing things such as avoiding situations, worrying excessively, smoking and/or drinking too much, overeating or under eating. Unfortunately, while these strategies can give some short-term relief from stress or illusion of the same, they tend to make matters worse in the longer term. 
			There are other strategies that can be more helpful, both in the short-term, and especially not cause more problems than they solve in the short-term. Since every individual has a unique response to stress there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to managing it.
			Below are our top tips for managing stress:<br></p>

		<br><b><p style="color:beige;">1)Limit unnecessary stress</b>
			<br>
		<br><b>Learn how to say no</b> – both on a professional and personal level. You should never take on more than you can handle as this will be a definite recipe for stress.<br>
		<br>
		<br><b>Cut down your to-do list</b> – Analyse your schedule and prioritise your tasks by level of urgency.<br>
		<br>
		<br><b>Limit the amount of time you spend with people who stress you out</b> – If someone consistently causes stress in your life, limit the amount of time you spend with that person and be more aware of your reaction to them. Your reaction is thankfully something you can control.<br>
		<br>
		<br><b>Take control of the situation</b> – Identify how you can limit stress in a particular situation e.g. if grocery shopping makes you stressed do your grocery shopping at a less busy time or make a list. If driving to work stresses you out find a less busy route or cycle<br>

		<br><b>2)Change the situation or change your reaction to it</b>

		<br>This point all comes down to the very foundation of stress management which is all about taking control of your situation.

			When trying to cope with stress it is helpful to take a step back and ask yourself can I either
			Alter my situation in some way?
			and if I cannot make changes to improve my situation can I,
			Change my reaction?
		<br>
		<br>
		<br><b>3)Alter the situation</b>
		<br>
			If you cannot limit stress of a particular situation, try to alter it. Figure out what you can do to change things to reduce stress in your current situation & also to ensure the problem doesn’t present itself in the future.
		<br>
		<br><b>Make your feelings known</b> - instead of bottling them up - if something or someone is bothering you, communicate your concerns in an open and respectful way. If you don’t voice your feelings, resentment can build and the situation will likely remain the same.<br>
		<br>
		<br><b>Be assertive</b> - Don’t take a backseat in your own life. Deal with problems head on, doing your best to anticipate and prevent them. If a client in work gives you an unrealistic deadline be honest and firm with them and say you will need more time in order to adequately complete the task.<br>
		<br>
		<br><b>Improve your time management</b> - Poor time management can cause a lot of unnecessary stress. When you’re running behind on tasks it’s hard to stay calm and focused. But if you plan ahead and make sure you don’t overextend yourself, you can alter the amount of stress you’re under.<br>
